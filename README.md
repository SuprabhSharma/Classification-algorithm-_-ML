📌 Classification Models on Titanic Dataset

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning classification pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, and performance evaluation.

Algorithms used:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Naive Bayes

Models are evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to compare performance across different approaches.
